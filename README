This is a clone/fork of the great https://github.com/tordanik/OSM2World. OSM2World is an Open Source converter that creates three-dimensional models of the world in various formats from OpenStreetMap data.
Visit the project website at http://osm2world.org/ for documentation, downloads, screenshots and contact information!

This clone provides:
  - ant->maven with four modules. Separation of core representation creating and rendering (only core completed, rendering modules not yet compile clean).
  - LPEleConstraintEnforcer deleted for now because of native libs
  - povray removed from TreeModule
  - No CLI option GUI in module core
  - No image export in module core for now because of JOGL dependency
